/*
	In C++, both copy constructor and copy assignment 
	operator are used for creating copies of an existing object. 
	However, they have different purposes and behaviors:

	Copy constructor: 
	A copy constructor is a special constructor 
	that initializes a new object using an existing object of the same class. 
	It is used when an object is created from an existing object, 
	either by direct initialization, function parameter passing by value, 
	or by returning an object by value. The copy constructor takes a reference 
	to an object of the same class as an argument, and creates a new object 
	with the same state as the original object.

	Copy assignment operator: 
	The copy assignment operator is an overloaded operator that is used to assign 
	the contents of one object to another object of the same class. 
	It is used when an object is assigned to another object using 
	the assignment operator (=). The copy assignment operator takes a reference 
	to an object of the same class as an argument, and copies the state of 
	the original object to the new object.

	While both copy constructor and copy assignment operator create copies of an object, 
	they differ in how they are called and when they are used. 
	The copy constructor is used when a new object is created from an existing object, 
	while the copy assignment operator is used when an existing object 
	is assigned to another existing object. In addition, the copy constructor is called 
	only once during the creation of a new object, while the copy assignment operator 
	may be called multiple times during the lifetime of an object.
