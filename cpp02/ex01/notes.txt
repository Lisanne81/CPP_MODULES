--Write: An overload of the insertion (Â«) operator that inserts a floating-point representation
--of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as parameter.

This is a declaration of the insertion operator (<<) for a class called Fixed, 
which is designed to represent fixed-point numbers. 
The operator overloads the standard output stream (std::ostream) 
to allow instances of the Fixed class to be outputted to the console or a file.

The declaration specifies two parameters:

The first parameter is a reference to an output stream (std::ostream& out), 
which represents the stream to which the output is being sent.
The second parameter is a reference to a constant Fixed object (const Fixed& fixed), 
which represents the Fixed object being outputted.
The operator returns a reference to the output stream (std::ostream&), 
which allows for chaining of multiple insertion operators to output multiple objects in a single statement.

The definition of the << operator would typically be defined outside of the class definition, 
like this:

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fixed& fixed) {
    // code to output the Fixed object to the output stream goes here
    return out;
}
The actual code inside the function will depend on how the Fixed class is implemented 
and how the fixed-point number is represented internally. 
The goal is to format the output in a way that makes sense for 
the fixed-point number being represented, and to output the result to 
the specified output stream.
